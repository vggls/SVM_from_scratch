# Support_Vector_Machines_-under_construction-
- In "summary.pdf" we give a short math summary on the steps that lead to the computation of the "optimal margin linear boundary" and of the "optimal margin kernelized 
  boundary", for the case of non-linearly separable data
- In "smo.ipynb" we first code two variations of the SMO algorithm in order to find the support vectors of a hyperplane for a fixed "penalty" hyperparamater C. We then
  make use of the Kernel Trick and slightly alter the SMO in order to find the support vectors for a kernelized (non-linear) boundary
- In "compare_classifiers.ipynb" we compare the support vector classifiers that result from the three aforementioned variations of SMO.
