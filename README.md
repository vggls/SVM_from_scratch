# Support_Vector_Machines_-under_construction-
- In "linear_smo.ipynb" we first give a short math summary on the steps that lead to the computation of the "optimal margin linear boundary" for the case of non-linearly 
  separable data. We code two variations of the SMO algorithm which finds the support vectors of the hyperplane for a fixed "penalty" hyperparamater C.
- In "kernel_smo.ipynb" we use the Kernel Trick to alter the SMO algorithm in such a way that it finds the support vectors of an "optimal margin kernelized boundary".
- In "compare_classifiers.ipynb" we compare the support vector classifiers that result from the three aforementioned variations of SMO.
